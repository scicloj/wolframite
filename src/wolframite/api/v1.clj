  "Initialize Wolframite and start! the underlying Wolfram Kernel - required once before you make any eval calls.

  - `opts` - a map that is passed to `eval` and other functions used in the convert-evaluate-parse
             cycle, which may contain, among others:
     - `:aliases` - a map from a custom symbol to a symbol Wolfram understands, such as the built-in
        `{'* 'Times, ...}` - added to the default aliases from `wolframite.runtime.defaults/all-aliases`
        and used when converting symbols at _function position_ to Wolfram expressions.
        You may add your own ones, to be able to use them in your Wolfram expressions and get those
        translated into Wolfram ones. See Wolframite docs.
     -  `:flags #{kwd ...}` - various on/off toggles for how Wolframite processes inputs/results,
        passed e.g. to the `custom-parse` multimethod; see also wolframite.flags

   Returns the result of the evaluation as Clojure data, ± in the Wolfram Input Form
   (see https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/TextualInputAndOutput.html). May throw.

    (wl/eval '(Plus 1 2))`
